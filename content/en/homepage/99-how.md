Each tournament PGN in `data/` becomes one tab. To add a new Titled Tuesday, save its PGN as `data/TTC_MMDDYY.pgn`, run `./build.sh TTC_MMDDYY.pgn` and push.

Every game is replayed move by move and added to one tree per colour, counting how many games pass through each position and how that colour scored.
